# AMAZON_ML_challenge_2023
As part of the** Amazon ML challenge** 2023, I along with my team developed a machine learning model to predict product length from catalog metadata. The objective of the challenge was to facilitate efficient packaging and storage of products in the warehouse.

The training and testing data consisted of 2.2 million products, each with a unique product ID, title, description, bullet points, product type ID, and product length. My task was to build a model that could accurately predict the product length using these metadata features, despite the presence of noise in the data.

To evaluate the performance of my model, we used the mean root mean square error, and the score was calculated as r square. For submission, we created a .csv file with the index set as the product ID and the target variable as the predicted product length. The submission file had to be of size 734736 x 2 and contain the correct index values and column names as provided in the sample submission file.

Overall, this challenge provided me with the opportunity to develop my machine learning skills and apply them to a real-world problem faced by an industry-leading company like Amazon.
